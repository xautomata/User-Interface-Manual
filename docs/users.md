# Users

The **Users** section allows administrators to manage accounts that can access the XAUTOMATA platform.

Users represent individual operators who can log into the system and interact with dashboards, monitoring data, and administrative features.

User accounts define:

- authentication credentials
- contact information
- access permissions
- relationships with platform entities such as dashboards or groups

---

## Accessing the Users Section

Users are managed from:

```

Administration → Users

```

The page opens with a **pre-filter dialog** that allows administrators to limit the set of users displayed in the table.

---

## User Filters

The filter dialog includes the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| User | Username identifier |
| Email | User email address |
| Phone | Contact phone number |
| Email status | Indicates whether the user has verified their email address |
| Status | User account state (Active or Disabled) |
| ACL override | Optional override profile applied to the user |

Possible values include:

- **Email status**
  - Verified
  - Not verified

- **Status**
  - Active
  - Disabled

Filters allow administrators to quickly locate specific accounts in large environments.

---

## Users Table

After applying filters, the system displays a table of users.

Typical columns include:

| Column | Description |
|------|-------------|
| User | Unique identifier of the account |
| Email | User email address |
| Phone | Phone contact |
| Status | Indicates whether the account is active |

Each row provides quick access to two actions:

- **Connections view** (left icon) – opens the relationships of the user with other entities
- **Search / View** (magnifier icon) – opens the user record in a CRUD dialog

---

## Creating a User

To create a new account, click the **Add (+)** button in the page toolbar.

The creation dialog includes fields such as:

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| User | Unique username |
| Email | User email address |
| Password | Initial password |
| Phone | Optional phone number |
| Email status | Whether the email is verified |
| Status | Active or disabled account |

When creating a user, administrators must also configure the user's **ACL permissions**.

---

## Editing a User

Opening a user record displays the **User Details dialog**.

The dialog allows administrators to:

- update contact information
- enable or disable the account
- modify access permissions
- optionally change the user's password

When editing a user, an additional option appears:

```

Edit password

```

If enabled, the administrator can update the password.

The dialog also displays:

- **Last change** – timestamp of the last password modification.

---

## Access Control (ACL)

Each user is assigned an **Access Control List (ACL)** configuration that determines which actions they can perform within the platform.

Permissions are defined using **permission scopes**, which combine a functional domain with an operation.

Examples of permission scopes include:

```
main.read
main.create
tracking.update
admin.delete
```

These scopes define whether a user can perform operations such as reading, creating, updating, or deleting resources in different areas of the system.

The platform groups permissions into three main domains:

| Domain       | Description                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main**     | Core platform entities and general operations        |
| **Tracking** | Monitoring and tracking related resources            |
| **Admin**    | Administrative configuration and management features |

Within each domain, the following operations may be granted:

* read
* create
* update
* delete

Administrative permissions may also include the special **super** capability, which grants elevated administrative privileges.

---

### ACL Overrides

In addition to the base permission scopes, a user may be assigned an **ACL override profile**.

An ACL override applies predefined permission rules that may:

* restrict specific operations
* disable or hide fields in forms
* apply default values to certain fields

Overrides allow administrators to enforce more specific permission policies without modifying the user's base permission configuration.

ACL overrides are managed in the **Super Admin → ACL Overrides** section.

---

### Access Control Model

The complete access control model, including permission evaluation and override behavior, is described in the [**Access Control**](access_control.md) section of this documentation.

---

## User Connections

Users can be associated with several platform entities.

The **Connections View** allows administrators to manage these relationships.

Available connections include:

- Dashboards
- Groups
- Virtual Domains
- Customers
- Widget Groups

These relationships determine what data and dashboards a user can access.

For example:

- assigning dashboards defines what the user can see
- linking groups or customers restricts the scope of monitored infrastructure
- assigning widget groups controls available visual components

---

## Security Considerations

User accounts play a critical role in platform security.

Administrators should:

- ensure strong passwords
- regularly review ACL permissions
- disable accounts that are no longer in use
- verify user email addresses

Proper user management helps maintain a secure and controlled monitoring environment.
