> **NOTE** Not all dashboards are always visible; it depends on whether the user logged into the portal has visibility of the
> widgets contained within a dashboard. If none of the widgets in a dashboard are visible to that user, 
> the dashboard itself will not be displayed on the interface. The visibility of widgets depends on the type 
> of data collected by XAUTOMATA to manage digitized processes and the type of contract in place.
