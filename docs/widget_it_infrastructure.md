rate greater than 99.95% over the past month.

    If I have 4 infrastructure objects, 3 of them have a monthly average availability 
    of 100%, and one of them has a monthly average availability of 90%, this widget will show 
    an indication of 75%, since 3 out of 4 objects have a monthly average availability greater than 99.95%.

based on their average availability calculated over the last week. All objects with 
an availability rate below 99.5% fall into the leftmost column, highlighted in red.

detailed information on the objects present in that column and their exact average availability values.
