Every machine with more than one component  will also have a sanity calculated based on the combination of the sanity of  the individual components.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>Memory sanity helps to understand whether the infrastructure is  suffering from excessive memory use, but this provides a partial view of reality.  If we consider a database, it often allocates all the memory available to it even if it is not utilizing it. In this scenario, memory would be incorrectly indicated with a 0%. For this reason, the sanity of the entire machine has been created.  This type of sanity aims to approximate what is a more application-specific check,  where a 0% memory usage is weighed together with other characteristics, which can  lead to a collective sanity greater than 0, thus providing a more accurate estimation  of the health status of the example database.</p> <p>Sanity is calculated based on the behavior of the value metrics on a weekly scale.</p> <p>The widget consists of 3 views represented in the figure below with the three numbers. </p> <p>The first view shows a histogram that categorizes objects by their sanity.
